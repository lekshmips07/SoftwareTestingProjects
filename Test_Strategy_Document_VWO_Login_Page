Objective
The goal of this Test Strategy is to define the testing scope, approach, resources, and deliverables for validating the login functionality of app.vwo.com. The intent is to ensure secure, robust, and user-friendly login behavior across all supported environments.

Scope

In-Scope

Functional testing of login workflow:

Valid credentials

Invalid credentials (incorrect username/password)

Blank field submissions

Case sensitivity

Locked/disabled account

Password masking

Remember Me functionality

Error message validations

UI/UX validation (responsive design, field alignment, tab orders)

Security aspects of login:

SQL Injection

Brute force resilience

Password in logs or network

HTTPS validation

API-level login request/response validation

Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

Accessibility validation (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Out-of-Scope

Multi-factor authentication (if not implemented yet)

"Forgot Password" workflow (covered in a separate module)

User registration & profile management

Backend database performance optimization

Test Objectives

Verify login form accepts and processes correct user credentials

Ensure incorrect/invalid inputs are gracefully handled

Validate that security best practices are in place for login

Confirm visual consistency across major browsers

Check error messages, navigation behavior, and form validations
